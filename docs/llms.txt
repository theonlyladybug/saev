Module saev
===========
saev is a Python package for training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on vision transformers (ViTs) in PyTorch.

The main entrypoint to the package is in `__main__`; use `python -m saev --help` to see the options and documentation for the script.

# Guide to Training SAEs on Vision Models

1. Record ViT activations and save them to disk.
2. Train SAEs on the activations.
3. Visualize the learned features from the trained SAEs.
4. (your job) Propose trends and patterns in the visualized features.
5. (your job, supported by code) Construct datasets to test your hypothesized trends.
6. Confirm/reject hypotheses using `probing` package.

`saev` helps with steps 1, 2 and 3.

.. note:: `saev` assumes you are running on NVIDIA GPUs. On a multi-GPU system, prefix your commands with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=X` to run on GPU X.

## Record ViT Activations to Disk

To save activations to disk, we need to specify:

1. Which model we would like to use
2. Which layers we would like to save.
3. Where on disk and how we would like to save activations.
4. Which images we want to save activations for.

The `saev.activations` module does all of this for us.

Run `uv run python -m saev activations --help` to see all the configuration.

In practice, you might run:

```sh
uv run python -m saev activations \
  --model-group clip \
  --model-ckpt ViT-B-32/openai \
  --d-vit 768 \
  --n-patches-per-img 49 \
  --layers -2 \
  --dump-to /local/scratch/$USER/cache/saev \
  --n-patches-per-shard 2_4000_000 \
  data:imagenet-dataset
```

This will save activations for the CLIP-pretrained model ViT-B/32, which has a residual stream dimension of 768, and has 49 patches per image (224 / 32 = 7; 7 x 7 = 49).
It will save the second-to-last layer (`--layer -2`).
It will write 2.4M patches per shard, and save shards to a new directory `/local/scratch$USER/cache/saev`.

.. note:: A note on storage space: A ViT-B/16 will save 1.2M images x 197 patches/layer/image x 1 layer = ~240M activations, each of which take up 768 floats x 4 bytes/float = 3072 bytes, for a **total of 723GB** for the entire dataset. As you scale to larger models (ViT-L has 1024 dimensions, 14x14 patches are 224 patches/layer/image), recorded activations will grow even larger.

This script will also save a `metadata.json` file that will record the relevant metadata for these activations, which will be read by future steps.
The activations will be in `.bin` files, numbered starting from 000000.

To add your own models, see the guide to extending in `saev.activations`.

## Train SAEs on Activations

To train an SAE, we need to specify:

1. Which activations to use as input.
2. SAE architectural stuff.
3. Optimization-related stuff.

`The `saev.training` module handles this.

Run `uv run python -m saev train --help` to see all the configuration.

Continuing on from our example before, you might want to run something like:

```sh
uv run python -m saev train \
  --data.shard-root /local/scratch/$USER/cache/saev/ac89246f1934b45e2f0487298aebe36ad998b6bd252d880c0c9ec5de78d793c8 \
  --data.layer -2 \
  --data.patches patches \
  --data.no-scale-mean \
  --data.no-scale-norm \
  --sae.d-vit 768 \
  --lr 5e-4
```

`--data.*` flags describe which activations to use.

`--data.shard-root` should point to a directory with `*.bin` files and the `metadata.json` file.
`--data.layer` specifies the layer, and `--data.patches` says that want to train on individual patch activations, rather than the [CLS] token activation.
`--data.no-scale-mean` and `--data.no-scale-norm` mean not to scale the activation mean or L2 norm.
Anthropic's and OpenAI's papers suggest normalizing these factors, but `saev` still has a bug with this, so I suggest not scaling these factors.

`--sae.*` flags are about the SAE itself.

`--sae.d-vit` is the only one you need to change; the dimension of our ViT was 768 for a ViT-B, rather than the default of 1024 for a ViT-L.

Finally, choose a slightly larger learning rate than the default with `--lr 5e-4`.

This will train one (1) sparse autoencoder on the data.
See the section on sweeps to learn how to train multiple SAEs in parallel using only a single GPU.

## Visualize the Learned Features

Now that you've trained an SAE, you probably want to look at its learned features.
One way to visualize an individual learned feature \(f\) is by picking out images that maximize the activation of feature \(f\).
Since we train SAEs on patch-level activations, we try to find the top *patches* for each feature \(f\).
Then, we pick out the images those patches correspond to and create a heatmap based on SAE activation values.

.. note:: More advanced forms of visualization are possible (and valuable!), but should not be included in `saev` unless they can be applied to every SAE/dataset combination. If you have specific visualizations, please add them to `contrib/` or another location.

`saev.visuals` records these maximally activating images for us.
You can see all the options with `uv run python -m saev visuals --help`.

So you might run:

```sh
uv run python -m saev visuals \
  --ckpt checkpoints/abcdefg/sae.pt \
  --dump-to /nfs/$USER/saev/webapp/abcdefg \
  --data.shard-root /local/scratch/$USER/cache/saev/ac89246f1934b45e2f0487298aebe36ad998b6bd252d880c0c9ec5de78d793c8 \
  --data.layer -2 \
  --data.patches patches \
  images:imagenet-dataset
```

This will record the top 128 patches, and then save the unique images among those top 128 patches for each feature in the trained SAE.
It will cache these best activations to disk, then start saving images to visualize later on.

`saev.interactive.features` is a small web application based on [marimo](https://marimo.io/) to interactively look at these images.

You can run it with `uv run marimo edit saev/interactive/features.py`.

Module saev.activations
=======================
To save lots of activations, we want to do things in parallel, with lots of slurm jobs, and save multiple files, rather than just one.

This module handles that additional complexity.

Conceptually, activations are either thought of as

1. A single [n_imgs x n_layers x (n_patches + 1), d_vit] tensor. This is a *dataset*
2. Multiple [n_imgs_per_shard, n_layers, (n_patches + 1), d_vit] tensors. This is a set of sharded activations.

:   An abstract class representing a :class:`Dataset`.
    
    All datasets that represent a map from keys to data samples should subclass
    it. All subclasses should overwrite :meth:`__getitem__`, supporting fetching a
    data sample for a given key. Subclasses could also optionally overwrite
    :meth:`__len__`, which is expected to return the size of the dataset by many
    :class:`~torch.utils.data.Sampler` implementations and the default options
    of :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. Subclasses could also
    optionally implement :meth:`__getitems__`, for speedup batched samples
    loading. This method accepts list of indices of samples of batch and returns
    list of samples.
    
    .. note::
      :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` by default constructs an index
      sampler that yields integral indices.  To make it work with a map-style
      dataset with non-integral indices/keys, a custom sampler must be provided.

====================

Functions
---------

`get_datasets()`
:   

`get_img_v_raw(key: str, i: int) ‑> tuple[pyvips.vimage.Image, str]`
:   Get raw image and processed label from dataset.
    
    Returns:
        Tuple of pyvips.Image and classname.

`pil_to_vips(img_p: PIL.Image.Image) ‑> pyvips.vimage.Image`
:   Convert a PIL Image to a pyvips Image.

`to_sized(img_v_raw: pyvips.vimage.Image, min_px: int, crop_px: tuple[int, int]) ‑> pyvips.vimage.Image`
:   Convert raw vips image to standard model input size (resize + crop).

`vips_to_base64(img_v: pyvips.vimage.Image) ‑> str`
:   

Classes
-------

`VipsImageFolder(root: str, transform: Callable | None = None, target_transform: Callable | None = None)`
:   Clone of ImageFolder that returns pyvips.Image instead of PIL.Image.Image.

`VipsImagenet(cfg: saev.config.ImagenetDataset, *, img_transform=None)`
:   An abstract class representing a :class:`Dataset`.
    
    All datasets that represent a map from keys to data samples should subclass
    it. All subclasses should overwrite :meth:`__getitem__`, supporting fetching a
    data sample for a given key. Subclasses could also optionally overwrite
    :meth:`__len__`, which is expected to return the size of the dataset by many
    :class:`~torch.utils.data.Sampler` implementations and the default options
    of :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. Subclasses could also
    optionally implement :meth:`__getitems__`, for speedup batched samples
    loading. This method accepts list of indices of samples of batch and returns
    list of samples.
    
    .. note::
      :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` by default constructs an index
      sampler that yields integral indices.  To make it work with a map-style
      dataset with non-integral indices/keys, a custom sampler must be provided.

Module saev.config
==================
All configs for all saev jobs.

## Import Times

This module should be very fast to import so that `python main.py --help` is fast.
This means that the top-level imports should not include big packages like numpy, torch, etc.
For example, `TreeOfLife.n_imgs` imports numpy when it's needed, rather than importing it at the top level.

Also contains code for expanding configs with lists into lists of configs (grid search).
Might be expanded in the future to support pseudo-random sampling from distributions to support random hyperparameter search, as in [this file](https://github.com/samuelstevens/sax/blob/main/sax/sweep.py).

---------

Module contrib.classification
=============================
# Reproduce

You can reproduce our classification control experiments from our preprint by following these instructions.

The big overview (as described in our paper) is:

1. Train an SAE on the ImageNet-1K patch activations from a CLIP ViT-B/16, from the 11th (second-to-last) layer.
2. Show that you get meaningful features, through visualizations.
3. Train a linear probe on the [CLS] token activations from  a CLIP ViT-B/16, from the 12th layer, on the Caltech-101 dataset. We use an arbitrary random train/test split.
4. Show that we get good accuracy.
5. Manipulate the activations using the proposed SAE features.
6. Be amazed. :)

To do these steps:

## Record ImageNet-1K activations

## Train an SAE on Activations

```sh
uv run python -m saev train \
  --sweep configs/preprint/classification.toml \
  --data.shard-root /local/scratch/$USER/cache/saev/ac89246f1934b45e2f0487298aebe36ad998b6bd252d880c0c9ec5de78d793c8/ \
  --data.layer -2 \
  --sae.d-vit 768
```

## Visualize the SAE Features

`` was the best checkpoint from my sweep.

```sh
uv run python -m saev visuals \
  --ckpt checkpoints/bd97z80b/sae.pt \
  --dump-to /research/nfs_su_809/workspace/stevens.994/saev/features/bd97z80b \
  --sort-by patch \
  --data.shard-root /local/scratch/stevens.994/cache/saev/ac89246f1934b45e2f0487298aebe36ad998b6bd252d880c0c9ec5de78d793c8/ \
  --data.layer -2 \
  --log-freq-range -2.5 -1.5 \
  --log-value-range 0.0 1.0 \
  images:imagenet-dataset
```

You can see some neat features in here by using `saev.interactive.features` with `marimo`.

## Record CUB-200-2011 Activations

For each `$SPLIT` in "train" and "test":

```sh
uv run python -m saev activations \
  --model-family clip \
  --model-ckpt ViT-B-16/openai \
  --d-vit 768 \
  --n-patches-per-img 196 \
  --layers -2 -1 \
  --dump-to /local/scratch/$USER/cache/saev \
  --n-patches-per-shard 2_4000_000 \
  data:image-folder-dataset \
  --data.root /nfs/datasets/caltech-101/$SPLIT
```

## Train a Linear Probe

```sh
uv run python -m contrib.classification \
  --n-workers 32 \
  --train-imgs.root /research/nfs_su_809/workspace/stevens.994/datasets/cub2011/train \
  --val-imgs.root /research/nfs_su_809/workspace/stevens.994/datasets/cub2011/test/ \
  --sweep contrib/classification/sweep.toml
  ```

Then look at `logs/contrib/classification/hparam-sweeps.png`. 
It probably works for any of the learning rates above 1e-5 or so.

## Manipulate

Now we will manipulate the inputs to the probe by using the directions proposed by the SAE trained on ImageNet-1K and observe the changes in the linear model's predictions.
There are two ways to do this:

1. The marimo dashboard, which requires that you run your own inference.
2. The online dashboard, which is more polished but offers less control.

Since you have gone through the effort of training all this stuff, you probably want more control and have the hardware for inference.

Run the marimo dashboard with:

```sh
uv run marimo edit contrib/classification/interactive.py
```

These screenshots show the kinds of findings you can uncover with this dashboard.

First, when you open the dashboard and configure the options, you will eventually see something like this:

![Default dashbaord view of a sunflower example.](/assets/contrib/classification/sunflower-unchanged.png)

The main parts of the dashboard:

1. Example selector: choose which test image to classify. The image is shown on the bottom left.
2. The top SAE latents for the test image's class (in purple below). The latent values of $h$ are also shown. Many will be 0 because SAE latents fire very rarely (*sparse* autoencoder).
3. The top SAE latents for another, user-selected class (in orange below). Choose the class on the top right dropdown.
4. The top classes as predicted by the pre-trained classification model (a linear probe; shown in green below). 
5. The top classes as predicted by the *same* pre-trained classification model, *after* modifying the dense vector representation with the SAE's vectors. These predictions are updated as you change the sliders on the screen.

![Annotated dashbaord view of a sunflower example.](/saev/assets/contrib/classification/sunflower-unchanged-annotated.png)

As an example, you can scale *up* the top bonsai features. 
As you do, the most likely class will be a bonsai.
See below.

![A sunflower changed to look like a bonsai.](/saev/assets/contrib/classification/class-manipulation.png)

Here's another example.
With another sunflower, you can manipulate turn up the SAE feature that fires strongly on pagodas and other traditionally Asian architectural structures.
If you do, the most likley classification is a lotus, which is popular in Japanese and other Asian cultures.

![A sunflower changed to be a lotus (a culturally Asian flower).](/saev/assets/contrib/classification/japanese-culture.png)

Only once you turn up the SAE feature that fires strongly on potted plants does the classification change to bonsai (which are typically potted).

![A sunflower changed to "bonsai".](/saev/assets/contrib/classification/bonsai.png)

I encourage you to look at other test images and manipulate the predictions!

Module contrib.semseg
=====================
You can reproduce our semantic segmentation control experiments from our preprint by following these instructions.

As an overview:

1. Record ViT activations for ADE20K.
2. Train a linear probe on semantic segmentation task using ADE20K.
3. Establish baseline metrics for the linear probe.
4. Automatically identify feature vectors in the SAE's \(W_dec\) matrix for each class in ADE20K.
5. Suppress those features in the vision transformer's activations before applying the linear probe.
6. Record class-specific metrics before and after suppression.

Details can be found below.

# Record ViT Activations for Linear Probe Training and SAE Inference

# Train a Linear Probe on Semantic Segmentation

Now train a linear probe on the activations.

```sh
uv run python -m contrib.semseg train \
  --train-acts.shard-root $TRAIN_SHARDS \
  --train-acts.layer -1 \
  --val-acts.shard-root $VAL_SHARDS \
  --val-acts.layer -1 \
  --imgs.root /nfs/$USER/datasets/ade20k/ \
  --sweep contrib/semseg/sweep.toml
```

# Establish Linear Probe Baseline Metrics

```sh
uv run python -m contrib.semseg validate \
  --imgs.root /nfs/$USER/datasets/ade20k/ \
  --acts.shard-root $VAL_SHARDS \
  --acts.layer -1
```

Then you can look in `./logs/contrib/semseg` for `hparam-sweeps.png` to see what learning rate/weight decay combination is best.

    list of samples.
    
    .. note::
      :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` by default constructs an index
      sampler that yields integral indices.  To make it work with a map-style
      dataset with non-integral indices/keys, a custom sampler must be provided.

`DinoV2()`
:   Base class for all neural network modules.
    
    Your models should also subclass this class.
    
    Modules can also contain other Modules, allowing to nest them in
    a tree structure. You can assign the submodules as regular attributes::
    
        import torch.nn as nn
        import torch.nn.functional as F
    
        class Model(nn.Module):
            def __init__(self) -> None:
                super().__init__()
                self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 20, 5)
                self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(20, 20, 5)
    
            def forward(self, x):
                x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
                return F.relu(self.conv2(x))
    
    Submodules assigned in this way will be registered, and will have their
    parameters converted too when you call :meth:`to`, etc.
    
    .. note::
        As per the example above, an ``__init__()`` call to the parent class
        must be made before assignment on the child.
    
    :ivar training: Boolean represents whether this module is in training or
                    evaluation mode.
    :vartype training: bool
    
    Initialize internal Module state, shared by both nn.Module and ScriptModule.

    ### Methods

    `forward(self, batch: jaxtyping.Float[Tensor, 'batch 3 width height']) ‑> Callable[..., Any]`
    :   Define the computation performed at every call.
        
        Should be overridden by all subclasses.
        
        .. note::
            Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within
            this function, one should call the :class:`Module` instance afterwards
            instead of this since the former takes care of running the
            registered hooks while the latter silently ignores them.

Module contrib.semseg.validation
================================
Make some predictions for a bunch of checkpoints.
See which checkpoints have the best validation loss, mean IoU, class-specific IoU, validation accuracy, and qualitative results.

Writes results to CSV files and hparam graphs (in-progress).

Functions
---------

`load_ckpts(root: str, *, device: str = 'cpu') ‑> list[tuple[contrib.semseg.config.Train, torch.nn.modules.module.Module]]`
:   Loads the latest checkpoints for each directory within root.
    
    Arguments:
        root: directory containing other directories with cfg.json and model_step{step}.pt files.
        device: where to load models.
    
    Returns:
        List of cfg, model pairs.

Module contrib.semseg.visuals
=============================
Propose features for manual verification.

Functions
---------

`axis_unique(a: jaxtyping.Shaped[ndarray, '*axes'], axis: int = -1, return_counts: bool = True, *, null_value: int = -1) ‑> jaxtyping.Shaped[ndarray, '*axes'] | tuple[jaxtyping.Shaped[ndarray, '*axes'], jaxtyping.Int[ndarray, '*axes']]`
:   Calculate unique values and their counts along any axis of a matrix.
    
    Arguments:
        a: Input array
        axis: The axis along which to find unique values.
        return_counts: If true, also return the count of each unique value
    
    Returns:
        unique: Array of unique values, with zeros replacing duplicates
        counts: (optional) Count of each unique value (only if return_counts=True)
